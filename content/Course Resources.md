## On Class Registration

Always check for open seats on Coursebook during registration period. If you are not content or have doubts with a class you are currently enrolled in, use the Swap feature to check the availability of other sections and potentially swap that class for your preferred section or other class. 
You can also waitlist for a class even if you are enrolled in another section of it. It's mind-blowing seeing people think that what they originally have is what they have to stick with. I haven't had a single semester without swapping a class at the last minute because of the professor or time. Seats are always added -- even a week or two before classes start.

## On Specializations

There are many specialties you can delve into while pursuing your Computer Science degree. Do not feel overwhelmed or behind just because somebody started pursuing a specialty sooner than you. You'll get imposter syndrome instead of enjoying the diversity of courses and opportunities to its fullest extent. Explore, explore, explore!

If you are thinking about acquiring certifications, be attentive to the types of exam questions and the retest policies.

I was unfortunate to fail an ISC2 exam on the first try. Even worse, the retest had to be more than thirty days after the first attempt. I initially thought the retake would also be free, but it turns out I had an exam voucher for one attempt only. I had to pay 200 dollars for the next one. EXTORTED!
