This is strictly based on my experience with these professors. For more information, visit:
- [UTDgrades](https://utdgrades.com/)
- [Coursebook](https://coursebook.utdallas.edu/) (check the evaluations and syllabuses in each section)
- [Rate My Professors](https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/)

I have not listed courses that I have taken through dual-enrollment or high school AP credit. I highly recommend taking professors for the classes that I have rated a 4 or 5.
